## About me
I am a PhD student on the Economics and Public Policy program at Imperial College London. My primary research interests are in development economics and applied econometrics, but I do find most economics research interesting.

### Research-in-progress

### Other projects
In Summer 2023, I worked as an intern at the Office of the Chief Economist at the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, where I worked on Chapter 2 of the Transtition Report 2023-24.
